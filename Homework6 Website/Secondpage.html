        <h1>Short Story and Artwork</h1>
        Summary of Into the Wild by John Krkauer: Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer tells the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who abandons his possessions and savings after college to live a life of adventure.
Rejecting materialism, he donates his money, cuts ties with his family, and travels across the American West under the name “Alexander Supertramp.”
Along the way, he meets various people who are inspired by his intelligence, idealism, and determination.
In 1992, he ventures alone into the Alaskan wilderness seeking self-reliance and spiritual clarity.
Unprepared for the harsh conditions, he becomes stranded in an abandoned bus and eventually dies of starvation.
Krakauer explores McCandless’s motivations, the risks of extreme individualism, and the fine line between courage and recklessness.
